with st.container():
    st.header("The Challenge: The Frustration Behind Finding a Foreman")
    st.markdown("""
    Finding the right construction foreman in Indonesia is often a gamble. The process is scattered, inefficient, and heavily reliant on subjective, word-of-mouth recommendations. Home and business owners often struggle to accurately compare skills, availability, and costs, which can lead to delayed projects or unsatisfactory results.

    **This is where Mandoor comes in as the solution.** Mandoor is an intelligent application designed to revolutionize this process. By harnessing the power of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, Mandoor transforms a complex search into a fast, data-driven, and trustworthy experience.

    st.markdown("""
    This was a **GROUP PROJECT** developed for the **Bangkit Academy Capstone** by a six-person team. What made this collaboration unique was that our members came from different universities (**UIN Sunan Kalijaga** and **Universitas Alma Ata**), creating a dynamic **multi-campus collaboration** across three divisions: **Machine Learning (ML)**, **Cloud Computing (CC)**, and **Mobile Development**.

    My role was **Machine Learning Engineer**. I did more than just write code; I was responsible for designing and building the **brain** behind the application. My tasks covered the entire machine learning workflow, from data collection to creating a functional model that forms the core of the Mandoor user experience.

        The first step was to build the data foundation. I performed **web scraping** on foreman profiles from the Indonesian services marketplace, `sejasa.com`, to gather crucial information like skills, location, and reviews.
        
        This raw data was then cleaned and processed through a **preprocessing** stage:
        - **Tokenization:** Converting narrative user project descriptions into a format the model could understand.
        - **Normalization:** Scaling numerical features (like cost or ratings) to a uniform range, ensuring no single feature dominated the model's learning process.

        st.markdown("""
        With the data prepared, I built the recommendation model using **TensorFlow** with a **Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)** architecture.
        
        This model is designed to 'understand' the nuances of user project descriptions (textual data) and match them with the most suitable foreman profiles (numerical data). The result is a **'relevance score'**‚Äîa number that intelligently measures how well-suited a foreman is for a job. This score is what the application uses to present a ranked list of top recommendations to the user.

    1.  **Technical Mastery:** This project solidified my understanding of the **end-to-end machine learning lifecycle**, from the challenges of data scraping to developing a hybrid model that handles both text and numerical data in **TensorFlow**.
    2.  **Product Mindset:** I learned that data quality is the absolute foundation of any successful AI product. A model is only as good as the data it's trained on.
    3.  **Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration:** Working closely with the Cloud and Mobile teams taught me the importance of effective communication to create a well-integrated product. This experience strengthened my desire to continue learning in a collaborative, product-focused environment like the **Apple Developer Academy**.
